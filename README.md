Fulmine is a Bitcoin wallet daemon that integrates Ark protocol's batched transaction model with Lightning Network infrastructure, enabling routing nodes, service providers and payment hubs to optimize channel liquidity while minimizing on-chain fees, without compromising on self-custody.

## üöÄ Usage

### üê≥ Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run fulmine is using Docker. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name fulmine \
  -p 7000:7000 \
  -p 7001:7001 \
  -v fulmine-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/arklabshq/fulmine:latest
```

Once the container is running, you can access the web UI at [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001).

To view logs:

```bash
docker logs -f fulmine
```

To stop the container:

```bash
docker stop fulmine
```

### üíª Using the Binary

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/ArkLabsHQ/fulmine/releases) for your platform. After downloading:

1. Extract the binary
2. Make it executable (on Linux/macOS): `chmod +x fulmine`
3. Run the binary: `./fulmine`

### üîß Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `FULMINE_DATADIR` | Directory to store wallet data | `/app/data` in Docker, `~/.fulmine` otherwise |
| `FULMINE_HTTP_PORT` | HTTP port for the web UI and REST API | `7001` |
| `FULMINE_GRPC_PORT` | gRPC port for service communication | `7000` |
| `FULMINE_ARK_SERVER` | URL of the Ark server to connect to | It pre-fills with the default Ark server |
| `FULMINE_ESPLORA_URL` | URL of the Esplora server to connect to | It pre-fills with the default Esplora server |

When using Docker, you can set these variables using the `-e` flag:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name fulmine \
  -p 7001:7001 \
  -e FULMINE_HTTP_PORT=7001 \
  -e FULMINE_ARK_SERVER="https://server.example.com" \
  -e FULMINE_ESPLORA_URL="https://mempool.space/api" \
  -v fulmine-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/arklabshq/fulmine:latest
```

## üìö API Documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

**IMPORTANT**: The REST API and gRPC interfaces are currently **not protected** by authentication. This is a known limitation and is being tracked in [issue #98](https://github.com/ArkLabsHQ/fulmine/issues/98). 

**DO NOT** expose these interfaces over the public internet until authentication is implemented. The interfaces should only be accessed from trusted networks or localhost.

While the wallet seed is encrypted using AES-256 with a password that the user set, the API endpoints themselves are not protected.

### üîå API Interfaces

fulmine provides three main interfaces:

1. **Web UI** - Available at [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001) by default
2. **REST API** - Available at [http://localhost:7001/api](http://localhost:7001/api)
3. **gRPC Service** - Available at `localhost:7000`

### üí∞ Wallet Service

1. Generate Seed

   ```sh
   curl -X GET http://localhost:7001/api/v1/wallet/genseed
   ```

2. Create Wallet

   Password must:
   - Be 8 chars or longer
   - Have at least one number
   - Have at least one special char

   Private key supported formats:
   - 64 chars hexadecimal
   - Nostr nsec (NIP-19)
  
   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://localhost:7001/api/v1/wallet/create \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"private_key": <hex or nsec>, "password": <strong password>, "server_url": "https://server.example.com"}'
   ```

3. Unlock Wallet

   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://localhost:7001/api/v1/wallet/unlock \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"password": <strong password>}'
   ```

4. Lock Wallet

   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://localhost:7001/api/v1/wallet/lock \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"password": <strong password>}'
   ```

5. Get Wallet Status

   ```sh
   curl -X GET http://localhost:7001/api/v1/wallet/status
   ```

### ‚ö° Service API

1. Get Address

   ```sh
   curl -X GET http://localhost:7001/api/v1/address
   ```

2. Get Balance

   ```sh
   curl -X GET http://localhost:7001/api/v1/balance
   ```

3. Send funds offchain

   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://localhost:7001/api/v1/send/offchain \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"address": <ark address>, "amount": <in sats>}'
   ```

4. Send funds onchain

   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://localhost:7001/api/v1/send/onchain \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"address": <bitcoin address>, "amount": <in sats>}'
   ```

5. Get transaction history

   ```sh
   curl -X GET http://localhost:7001/api/v1/transactions
   ```

Note: Replace `http://localhost:7001` with the appropriate host and port where your fulmine is running. Also, ensure to replace placeholder values (like `strong password`, `ark_address`, etc.) with actual values when making requests.

For more detailed information about request and response structures, please refer to the proto files in the `api-spec/protobuf/fulmine/v1/` directory.
